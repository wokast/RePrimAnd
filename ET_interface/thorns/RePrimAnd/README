1. Purpose

Distribute the RePrimAnd Library; see
<https://github.com/wokast/RePrimAnd>.


The RePrimAnd library is a support library for general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics, providing:
An extensible, modular EOS framework (thermal + barotropic)
An algorithm for primitive variable recovery in ideal GRMHD

A link to the library documentation can be found at
https://github.com/wokast/RePrimAnd

The article describing the algorithm is
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.023018

RH: any requested citations (doesn't have to be in this file, but goes into
einsteintoolkit.bib)? See: http://einsteintoolkit.org/citation.html
RH: would be good if contact information (email) was provided
