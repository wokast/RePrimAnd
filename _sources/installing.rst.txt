Installation
============

The main target and devolpment platform is Linux, although the
library code is not platform-specific and should also work on Macs.
Windows and AIX are not supported. For use in HPC, users need to build 
the library from source. For use in postprocessing, the Python interface
can also be installed via pip (binary wheel of the library available for 
Linux). There is also an experimental conda package for the C++ 
library (Python interface not included yet).

Requirements
------------

* A C++11 capable compiler (tested with gcc and clang). 
* Meson build system.
* Boost library.
* GNU Scientific Library version >= 2.0 
* HDF5 library (Only C-bindings required, not the C++ API).
* Doxygen (only for documentation)
* Sphinx with Breathe and bibtex extensions (only for documentation)
* Python matplotlib (only for benchmark plots)

Building from Source
--------------------

The library is build using the modern
`Meson <https://mesonbuild.com>`_
build system, which is 
`available <https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html>`_
as standard package in most distributions and can also be installed 
via Python's pip.

To build the library, 

.. code::

   cd <repository>
   meson setup --buildtype=release --prefix=<custom install location> mbuild
   ninja -C mbuild
   
This will compile with optimization and without debug symbols. Other
possibilities are `--buildtype=debug` and `--buildtype=debugoptimized`.
To use a different compiler, e.g. clang, prefix the meson command
with `CC=clang CXX=clang++`.
See `here <https://mesonbuild.com/Running-Meson.html>`_ for general 
Meson usage.


Note on Conda environments: if you build for a conda environment and meson 
does not detect the boost library or the wrong version, use 

:: code::
   
   BOOST_ROOT=$CONDA_PREFIX meson setup --prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX mbuild


Note on HDF5: meson and HDF5 library do not play along nicely (partly caused by bad HDF5 
packaging). Make sure there is a pkg-config file for the HDF5 library you want to build 
against. Another common source of problems is that you are building within a conda environment and there exists another system-wide HDF5 installation. In that case, 
prefixing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with `$CONDA_PREFIX/lib` might help.

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^

To install the library, use

.. code::

   ninja -C mbuild install
   
This will install in a user-defined location if the `--prefix` option
was given during the build setup, otherwise systemwide (not recommended). 


Using the Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The various header files needed for using the library are installed 
in a subdirectory `reprimand`. The executables have to be linked
with library `RePrimAnd`.

A minimal example can be found in `example/minimal.cc`. Assuming
the library is installed where the compiler (below we use gcc as 
example) can find it, compilation should be straightforward:

.. code:: bash

   g++ -lRePrimAnd --std=c++11 minimal.cc


Python Bindings
---------------


If only the Python interface is required on a Linux platform, 
it is easiest to install from pypi

.. code::

   pip install reprimand


Otherwise, one first has to buid and install the C++ library as shown above.

To build and install the Python interface, do

.. code::

   cd <repository>
   pip install ./bindings/python


This will also pip install packages `numpy` and `pybind11>=2.6.0`. 
When using conda environment, it may be better to install those 
first using conda.


The Python extension module is called  `pyreprimand`.


Einstein Toolkit Support
------------------------

RePrimAnd does provide a thorn that builds the library within
an EinsteinToolkit (ET) environment, using the ExternalLibraries mechanism. 
The thorn is part of the official ET framework. The version in the master 
brach of this repository may however be ahead of the ET version.
It can be found in the folder `ET_interface/thorns/RePrimAnd/`. The thorn
depends on the HDF5, GSL, and BOOST ExternalLibraries thorns. Building it via
the ET build system does not require meson. Note this only builds the library,
but not the tests and Python bindings. 

There are two experimental (and largely undocumented for now) thorns 
that aim to simplifying the usage.
`RePrimAnd_Global_EOS` provides a centralized selection of a global thermal 
EOS (e.g. for evolution and analysis) and a global barotropic EOS (e.g. for 
initial data).
`RePrimAnd_EOS_Omni_API` provides the most important subset of the `EOS_Omni` thorn 
interface, forwarding EOS calls to the reprimand EOS set by `RePrimAnd_Global_EOS`.
It is intended for transitioning existing code to the new interface.



Creating Documentation
----------------------

Building the documentation is deactivated by default. 
To build it, do

.. code::

   meson configure -Dbuild_documentation=true mbuild
   ninja -C mbuild documentation

The resulting pages can be found in the build directory under
`docsrc/sphinx/index.html`.

The building of the documentation requires sphinx with the breathe 
and sphinxcontrib-bibtex extensions as well as doxygen.

If the documentation is build, it is installed automatically when 
installing the library, by default to 
`<prefix>/usr/local/share/doc/libreprimand/index.html`.

Running Tests
-------------

Unit tests
^^^^^^^^^^

Building the unit tests is deactivated by default. 
To build them, specify

.. code::

   meson configure -Dbuild_tests=true
   ninja test
   
Please report errors on the 
`issue tracker <https://github.com/wokast/RePrimAnd/issues>`_.

Benchmarks
^^^^^^^^^^

The repository contains code to map the efficiency and accuracy of
the primitive recovery, producing the plots shown in the 
article. To recreate the data and plots,


.. code::

   meson configure -Dbuild_benchmarks=true
   ninja benchplots
   ninja accuracyplots
   
The resulting pdf figures are placed in the build directory under
`tests/benchmarks`.

This requires Python+matplotlib.

Visualizing Con2Prim Master Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition, there is code to sample the primitive recovery master
function (the central ingredient of the scheme) for various cases,
as shown in the paper.

.. code::

   meson configure -Dbuild_benchmarks=true
   ninja srootdata
  
The resulting data files are placed in the build directory under 
`tests/sample_root/`.
